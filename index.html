         <h3>best education method</h3>
         <h4>The best teaching method is the one that your students respond to. A master teacher adjusts his or her methods and strategies in response to his or her students’ ability to learn the material being presented.I can propose that direct instruction is best used when working with students below grade level. Many of these students did not understand the material initially and may need to see the material applied explicitly through modeling and “think alouds”. But this doesn't mean all students respond best to direct instruction for all subjects.</h4>

          <h3>top management</h3>
          <h4>According to NBR ISO 9000:2015 on quality management – Terms and definitions, Top Management “is a person or group of people who directs and controls an organization at the highest level.” It is also states that “Top management has the power to delegate authority and provide resources within the organization.”
           This means that top management is who holds authority, resources and decision-making power regarding changes at the company. In addition to leadership, it should also show a commitment with respect to the quality management system.</h4>

          <h3>quality meeting</h3>
          <h4>Well-run meetings are an important aspect of work place coordination and are vital to drive forward organisational strategy.  If done well, they connect executive teams, managers and employees to the organisational mission. They create meaning and purpose for individuals and bind them to organisational objectives.  Crucially, they also create understanding, can be highly motivational and generate the ‘corporate energy’ that drives organisations forward towards delivering on their strategic goals.</h4>

           <p class="para">Five years ago I decided to make the switch from sales to product management.  Your course was the stepping stone for me to build a framework for approaching product management in a structured and repeatable way.  My goal was always to see how I stacked up against Stanford and Berkeley MBA product managers by moving to the US. Since relocating to Silicon Valley I’ve been promoted several times, launched a few products, worked with some of the biggest companies in the world,</p>
